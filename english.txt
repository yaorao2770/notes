#. A class is a blueprint from which we can create objects that share the same configuration - properties and methods

 The decision to use a class or an interface truly depends on our use case: type-checking only, implementation details (typically via creating a new instance), or even both! 

 type-checking  

 We can use classes for type-checking and the underlying implementation - whereas we cannot with an interface.

#. TypeScript boosts JavaScript classes with extra power such as type-checking and static properties.

	boost

	it wants the government to take action to boost the economy.

	a great welcome boost

#. This also means that whenever we transpile our code to whatever target JavaScript of our choice, the transpiler will keep all of our class code present in the transpiled file. Hence, classes are present throughout all the phases of our code.

#. we are using a handy TypeScript shorthand to define class properties from the arguments of the constructor
